        <p>Make this healthy version of the tasty Thai classic in less 
            time than it takes to have it delivered.
             If you have fish sauce and aren't a strict vegetarian, 
             ubstitute it for the soy sauce. It will give the dish deeper 
             flavor. </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Soak noodles according to package instructions; drain. 
                    In a small bowl, whisk together lime juice, 
                    soy sauce, chili sauce, and brown sugar.</li>
                <li>In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1/2 teaspoon oil over 
                    medium-high, tilting to coat pan. Add eggs, swirl to coat 
                    bottom, and cook until just set, about 1 minute. Transfer 
                    eggs to a cutting board, loosely roll up, and cut crosswise 
                    into thin strips. Add 4 teaspoons oil to skillet and heat. 
                    Add tofu in a single layer and cook until golden brown on both 
                    sides, 7 minutes, 
                    flipping halfway through. Transfer to cutting board.</li>
                <li>Add 1 1/2 teaspoons oil, carrots, garlic, and scallion whites 
                    to skillet and cook until softened, 5 minutes. 
                    Add lime-juice mixture and bring to a simmer. 
                    Add noodles and cook, stirring frequently, 1 minute. 
                    Add eggs and tofu and gently toss to combine. Season to taste 
                    with salt. Divide among 4 plates and top with peanuts, cilantro, 
                    and scallion greens. Serve with lime wedges.</li>
